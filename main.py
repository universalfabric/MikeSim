"""
This is my main file for a mess around project.

Should be very simple.

Objective is to use code knowledge to date outside of the regular class structure.

Ideas:

1. Simple combat, 1 v 1
    Create player object and monster object.
    determine a turn system.
    give player and monster attributes, armor class, weapons, etc.
    implement in a progressive way, adding complexity along the way.
